# PDE-Deep_Learning-vs-FFT

This repo consists of two projects based on Option pricing using deep learning.

1. Using Neural Networks on synthetic and real world data to learn the analytical pricing equations.
2. Using DGM model to solve the BS PDE and other complex PDE's directly using custom loss functions.
