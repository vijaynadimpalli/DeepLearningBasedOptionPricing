# Implementation of the Deep Galerkin Method

The DGM model in this repo is from "DGM: A deep learning algorithm for solving partial differential equations" by J. Sirignano and K. Spiliopoulos (Journal of Computational Physics, 2018 - https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07469).

The methods used in this project follows "Solving Nonlinear andHigh-Dimensional PartialDifferential Equations viaDeep Learning" https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08782.pdf
